\section{Introduction}
Using the Socket Programming and the GET & POST methods from HTTP , client and server can have two way communication and send over or receive files over the connection.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this lab is to give hands-on experience with socket programming and HTTP file transfer. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item implementing multi-threaded chat from many clients to one server 
    \item setting up an HTTP server process with a few objects
    \item using GET and POST methods to upload and download objects in between HTTP clients and a server
\end{itemize}

\section{File Transfer via Socket Programming}

\subsection{Server}
In the server side, we turn on the socket and wait for the client to connect. Using the connection, the client can request a file and send a file to the server. If the file does not exist, an error message is shown.

\subsection{Client}
In the client side, we connect to the server. Using the connection, the server can request a file and send a file to the client. If the file does not exist, an error message is shown.
